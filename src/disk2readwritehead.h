/**
 * @brief Disk ][ read/write head assembly
 *
 * Represents the read/write head assembly of a Disk ][ floppy drive.
 * The assembly includes a "sled" that can move back and forth, with a
 * read/write head attached to it. The sled is moved by the rotor from
 * the stepper motor.
 *
 * Rotation of the rotor will cause the sled to move back or forth, along
 * with the read/write head, positioning it over a "track" on the floppy disk.
 *
 * If the rotor attempts to move the sled too far, the sled will resist and
 * prevent the rotor from rotating.

     * The Disk ][ has a "stop" at track zero, but not at the high end,

     * Typical disks have 35 tracks, and allow quarter-track precision.
