 * @brief WOZ file (floppy disk image)

 * The disk has 141 quarter-track possible positions, but
 * typically will have 35 tracks.
 * The floppy disk "knows" it's rotational position.
 *
 * Note, the floppy has no notion of the current track;
 * rather, that information is known by the stepper motor and arm.
